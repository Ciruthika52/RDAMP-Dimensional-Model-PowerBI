# RDAMP-Dimensional-Model-PowerBI

## Project Title: Dimensional Modeling, SQL Transformation & Power BI Reporting

### Dimensional Schema Overview
To support effective analysis and reporting, a Star Schema was designed and implemented. This schema centralizes transactional data in a fact table and connects it to surrounding dimension tables for descriptive context.

A Star Schema was chosen for its simplicity and query efficiency in business intelligence tools like Power BI.
